**Important notes**

 - I think the Firmware is official and not modified.
 - the firmware tested on a cars released in middle east and the infotainment was originally comes with multiple languages including English and Arabic and was **not in Chinese**. 
 - i have tested it myself on my own car which infotainment system originally has software version number ending with `00235`
 - After upgrade the software it shows software version`00193`

You can download the firmware and the PDF guide from this [Link](https://mega.nz/folder/4G0FiSJI#kYSL5spvA3UpBz8xa4nmcg).
